# New Article Workshop

Follow along with the in-class workshop. When you are done, you should be able to add new articles to the blog.

Create a `class-05` branch for your work. Copy the starter code into a new directory (that has your name). When it's complete, create a PR to the upstream class repo. Submit your PR link on Canvas.
